The data comes from the UCI Machine Learning repository and was collected via a survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk.

Findings:

1. Approximately 4 out of 10 drivers accpeted bar coupons.
2. People who drive to the bar more than once a month and visit cheaper restaurants more than 4 times a month with incomes less than 50k have a higher rate of coupon acceptance compared to the average of all drivers who visit cheaper restaurants more than 4 times a month and had incomes less than 50k. 
3. People who visit bars more than once a month tend to accept bar coupons at a higher rate than people who visit bars less than once a month while people who visited the bar 3 times or less accepted the coupons about 5 times more than people who visited the bar more than 3 times.  
4. Drivers that visit bar tend to accept less coupons than drivers that visit other places.

Typically, drivers who accept bar coupons are young, are single, visit cheaper restaurants more often and visit bars more than once a month.

Coffee House coupons follow the same pattern as the bar coupons in that the drivers that visited the coffee house more than once a month accepted coupons more often than drivers that visited a coffee house less than once or never. Drivers with occupation of Healthcare Practitioners and Technical had higher acceptance rate of coffee house coupons compared to Drivers with Production Occupation and an average of all other occupations.
